  * This course is designed as a follow-on to CSCA08, and continues the general introduction to creating and analyzing algorithms, with an emphasis on software design, data structures and basics of complexity analysis.
* CSCA67 - Discrete Mathematics
    * This course provides an introduction to discrete mathematics that computer and mathematical science students will need, both to introduce fundamental topics that are used extensively in upper year courses, and to build foundations in rigorous mathematical thinking.
* CSCB20 - Introduction to Databases and Web Applications
